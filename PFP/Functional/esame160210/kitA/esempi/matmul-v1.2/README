matmul-v1.2

This package contains different C implementations of a function for computing the 
product of two 1300x1300 matrices of 32 bit integers. The different versions show how 
to improve a base naive implementation to make it cache-friendly and use parallelism.

To compile and run the package you need a platform with a recent version of gcc and 
support for AVX 2 and pthreads. You may want to install perf to profile the code.

Istructions:

- compile the program: make
- run performance tests: make run
- check correctness of implementations: make check
- profile codes with perf: make perf
- clean the directory: make clean

Enjoy!
