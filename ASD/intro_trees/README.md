# Introduction to trees

To test out these snippets launch `./driver` with one of the possible sub-commands:
* "Tree": simple tree CRUD operations
* "Parse": given a tree structure in input through stdin parses it
* "Max": return the max level-value among all levels of the tree
* "Post order": carries out a post order visit. _This scenario can be found in every OS when the size a folder is requested: in fact the size of a folder is only characterised by its children, so we're forced to visit them first and then bubble up till the first ancestor_
